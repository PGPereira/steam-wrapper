<p>steam-wrapper is a bash script that essentially was written to help solve<br>
the problem on Steam on Linux distributions that were not Ubuntu Precise.<br>
On most other distributions (like Arch Linux with which this was written<br>
in mind), Steam may initially install successfully, but then hang on launch<br>
without any error message or indication.</p>

<p>steam-wrapper runs some common "fixes" which have been noted to be successful<br>
for various users. It does not guarantee frame rate improvements or even the<br>
ability to launch Steam. It does however, attempt to make diagnosing problems<br>
and launching Steam successfully easier to do.</p>

<p>Among other useful things, steam-wrapper provides an easy way to launch Steam<br>
using system native libraries instead of the packaged runtime. It does not<br>
ship with these native libraries however, and can certainly run with the<br>
Steam runtime.</p>

<p>It tries to make life a bit easier for those of us who can no longer enjoy<br>
Ubuntu Precise in 2016.</p>
