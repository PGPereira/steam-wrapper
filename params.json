{"name":"Steam-wrapper","tagline":"Steam wrapper for common operations","body":"# steam-wrapper\r\n\r\nsteam-wrapper is a bash script that essentially was written to help solve  \r\nthe problem on Steam on Linux distributions that were not Ubuntu Precise.  \r\nOn most other distributions (like Arch Linux with which this was written  \r\nin mind), Steam may initially install successfully, but then hang on launch  \r\nwithout any error message or indication.\r\n\r\nsteam-wrapper runs some common \"fixes\" which have been noted to be successful  \r\nfor various users. It does not guarantee frame rate improvements or even the  \r\nability to launch Steam. It does however, attempt to make diagnosing problems  \r\nand launching Steam successfully easier to do.\r\n\r\nAmong other useful things, steam-wrapper provides an easy way to launch Steam  \r\nusing system native libraries instead of the packaged runtime. It does not  \r\nship with these native libraries however, and can certainly run with the  \r\nSteam runtime.\r\n\r\nIt tries to make life a bit easier for those of us who can no longer enjoy  \r\nUbuntu Precise in 2016.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
